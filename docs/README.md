# github-final-project-part-1
A simple interest calculator (Final Project: Part 1 in [Getting Started with Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/getting-started-with-git-and-github) course, part of [IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer)).

# What does the project do?
The project is a calculator that calculates simple interest given principal amount, time period in years and annual rate of interest.

```
Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output:
   simple interest = p * t * r
```

## Scenario
I hosted a hypothetical company's sample code to calculate simple interest on GitHub in a new repository. I also followed best practices introduced in the course and created supporting documents for the open source project, including a code of conduct and contribution guidelines. Additionally, I made the repository available to the community under the Apache License 2.0.

## Objectives
1. Create a new repository in my GitHub account.
2. Select the appropriate license for my project.
3. Create a README.md file that explains the purpose of the project.
4. Create a Code of Conduct markdown that explains how I want the community to behave and interact with each other.
5. Create a Contribution Guidelines markdown that tells the community how to contribute.
6. Commit the new files to the repository.
